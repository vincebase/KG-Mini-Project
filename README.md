# Hi There :octocat: ðŸ‘‹
>>This is my very first project in KodeGo Philippines a bootcamp here that offers 3 months of web development training.
In this project we simulate how to use bootstrap 12 grid system with responsive container, row and columns using SASS.
This is purely a css/scss. 
This project give a glimpse of how other css frameworks works.
